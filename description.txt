# Description of the project

It is regarding the pill intake compliance by a patient, i.e whether he/she is taking the medication at right time or not.
The information we have been given is that a pill box filled with pills will be given.
A switch or any mechanism will ensure that only one pill falls from it.
Now, our problem statement is recording the time at which it has fallen{assuming pill is taken}.
Now, the our second part is to remotely send the information through bluetooth / other communication protocols to any such device to a phone.
The system is  expected to be light and portable.
This is mainly for old and people affected by neurological disorders.
They may not remember whether they had taken the prescribed medication or not. So, our system records the time at which pill has been dropped from the bottle. The info should be able to be retrieved  by bluetooth or wifi or worst case, by memory chip by the doctor.

The project is still under intial state.
