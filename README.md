It is regarding the pill intake compliance by a patient, i.e to keep tabs whether he/she is taking the medication at right time or not. A  pillbox filled with pills will be used. A switch or any mechanism will ensure that only one pill falls from it. Now, we will record the time at which it has fallen{assuming the pill is taken}. then the second part is to remotely send the information through Bluetooth / other communication protocols to any such device to a phone, and the pillbox is expected to be portable and light with user friendly 
This is mainly for old and people affected by neurological disorders.
They may not remember whether they had taken the prescribed medication or not. So, our system records the time at which pill has been dropped from the bottle. The info should be able to be retrieved  by bluetooth or wifi or worst case, by memory chip by the doctor.

The project is presently under work
